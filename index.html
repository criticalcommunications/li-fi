    <h2>A future with LiFi</h2>
    <p>LiFi as a concept was introduced almost ten years ago, with working prototypes to showcase the technology following soon after. Since then, a few LiFi focused startups have emerged, by offering consumer level products, as well as business applications targeted towards the retail, manufacturing, aeronautic and communications industries. Large corporations such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/10/24/signify-vodafone-lifi-wifi/">Vodafone</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/12/oledcomm-and-air-france-team-up-to-deploy-lifi-in-planes/">AirFrance</a> have initiated LiFi pilot projects, and <a href="https://www.ledsmagazine.com/smart-lighting-iot/article/16700600/german-high-school-transmits-lessons-via-the-lights">a few</a> <a href="https://purelifi.com/world-first-as-south-ayrshire-school-pupils-pilot-cutting-edge-lifi-technology/">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/lifi-technology-to-monitor-covid-19-patients/article31287574.ece">hospitals</a> have experimented with it as well. The LiFi market was valued globally at $4.2 billion in 2018, and is expected to <a href="https://www.industryarc.com/Report/15025/LiFi-market.html">grow beyond $140 billion by 2025</a>, at a predicted compound annual growth of over 75%.</p>

    <p>These are all indicators of strong momentum for the visible light communications industry, and start pointing at a future where LiFi could be as ubiquitous as WiFi or fiber optic are today. It’s hard to predict whether LiFi will actually hold up to the optimistic estimates – examples such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/the-rise-and-fall-of-firewire-the-standard-everyone-couldnt-quite-agree-on/">FireWire</a>, <a href="https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/services/article/21846160/whatever-happened-to-wimax">WiMax</a> or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/24/sony-minidisc-20-years">MiniDisc</a> prove that even technologies with a powerful design and strong corporate backing can fail to achieve widespread adoption. However, we can survey the research being done today as a means to understanding the potential hurdles towards adoption, as well as speculate on the possible ways it could impact our daily lives.</p>

    <p>One active area of research involves improving signal strength for the general use case of an end-user device having an arbitrary physical orientation. According to a paper published by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09269.pdf">Purwita et al</a>, the short wavelength of light makes device orientation become an important parameter which affects received signal strength. Looking at the big picture, this research implies that steps are being taken towards LiFi integration in mobile devices. While LiFi USB dongles for computers are already available on the market, they offer a static position and orientation with respect to the light source, hence controlling an optimal set of parameters for network signal. The evolution of this research area could heavily influence whether LiFi will become a viable solution for mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Researchers are also analyzing the usage of LiFi for accurate indoor location tracking. In a joint study led by <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1602/1602.07399.pdf">Huang et al.</a>, involving the School of Architecture and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, an experiment is made for using LiFi in conjunction with WiFi in order to track the location of WiFi/LiFi enabled devices in an indoor space. Using WiFi alone for this type of tracking has a location estimation error margin of several meters. The authors show an accuracy improvement of 80% when bringing LiFi into the equation. </p>

    <p>Accurate position estimation is an important selling point of the technology to the retail industry, and the authors do not shy away from mentioning this commercial application in their study. In-store targeted advertising and data collection could become a standard, turning in-person shopping into a privacy void – a similar experience to what we already encounter on online shopping platforms. </p>

    <p>Another argument Huang et al. make for the adoption of accurate location tracking using LiFi has environmental roots. The infrastructure and operation of buildings has a significant footprint on the environment: the study mentions a 70% of electricity load and 39% of carbon oxide emissions being associated with buildings. Smart buildings could better optimize their distribution of resources by having access to the location data of their inhabitants. </p>

    <p>The environmental argument is not new, as it often makes its way into the design decisions behind smart buildings and even <a href="https://reallifemag.com/the-captured-city/">smart cities</a>. However, the necessity of hyper accurate tracking remains unclear in this context, as sensor operated light systems and other existing mechanisms provide the same benefits, without the terrifying surveillance implications the new technology could bring. </p>

    <p>Projecting these ideas into the future, one can not help but imagine how LiFi technology could impact architectural and urban planning. On one side, this protocol offers the potential of enhanced security, as light waves can not penetrate walls. Are we likely to start noticing more “privacy rooms”, designed to have no external light sources? Or even “secure buildings”, with no windows? Or, is the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90285582/everyone-hates-open-plan-offices-heres-why-they-still-exist">open floor office</a> going to prevail, and promise to enhance digital connectivity, in addition to interpersonal communication? </p>

    <p>Considering the future of LiFi at an even larger scale – the city – raises questions around whether visible light communication could become an integral part of urban planning. Attaching LiFi infrastructure to a city’s public lighting system sounds like a logical next step once the technology is mature enough. Turning street lights into an internet connected centralized network operated by the city would cement the internet’s place in cities’ and nations’ critical infrastructure, and provide enhanced connectivity to device owners. However, the accurate location tracking capabilities offer the grim image of a smart city where surveillance is norm.</p>

    <p>The next ten to fifteen years of LiFi development are crucial, as they will force us as a society into redefining our set of views around personal privacy. How willing are we to share more about ourselves, if doing so leads to improved access to information, or education? What if accurate indoors location tracking turns out to have a significant environmental impact? We have been tackling similar issues for more than a decade now. The hope is for a future where we all have a say in answering these questions.</p>
